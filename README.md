#### Intro
This mini project aims to apply data warehouse creation techniques,
culminating in the creation of visualizations that add value to our data.

### Dataset Description
Our dataset is in the form of an Excel file with 4 sheets:

-Sales Orders<br>
-Customers<br>
-Regions<br>
-Products

### Project Steps

#### Initial Data Inspection
Upon first inspection, we determine that the granularity of our future data warehouse will be by Sales.

#### Data Import and Modeling

##### Importing Data:

Import the Excel file into Power BI.

##### Creating Relationships:

 1- Establish relationships between the dimension tables and the fact table following a star schema.<br>
 2-Fact Table: The Sales table, which contains some additional columns, is considered the fact table.<br>
 3-Add a Date table and relate it to the fact table.<br>
 4-Create the necessary DAX measures for our visualizations. The DAX queries are available in the DA EXPRESSIONS folder.
